"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

#### BLOCKQUOTES

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

#### LISTS

    1. Cut the cheese

     Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

    2. Slice the tomatoes

     Be careful when holding the knife.

     For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

#### SOFT BREAK

     We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
     They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
     Nor did it occur to one of us there  
     To doubt they were kneeling then.

     1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  

      Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
      If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!  

     2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  

      Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!   

## Exercise 2

#### SVG
**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an _XML-based markup language_ for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics.  
It's main use is to open Web standard for describing images that can be **neatly rendered at any size**. It works in compliance to other web standards like CSS, DOM, JavaScript and SMIL.   
As a former graphic designer, it is _useful to print larger files_ because the file **keeps the quality regarding of the file size**.  
Hence, this is vector format file is chosen over JPEG or PNG when it comes to advertise printing.  

#### MathMl
**Mathematical Markup Language (MML)** is an _XML-based markup language_ for describing mathematical notations and capture both its structure and content.
While LaTeX can also describe mathematics, MathMl **makes the user aware* of the mathematical concepts behind the notation.
As a former economy student, I used softwares which requires these features, such as __SPSS, Stata and Minitab__. These softwares use a language that can store several formulas / variables for further appliances.

#### X3D
**X3D** is an _XML-based markup language_ for representing 3D computer graphics. Its used to render projects in _architecture_, but can also be used for _product design_ as it allows you to render your product, _animation_ -like motion design_ and so on.
There are several applications, most of which are **open-source software**, which natively parse and interpret X3D files, including the 3D graphics and animation editor **Blender** and the Sun Microsystems virtual world client _Project Wonderland_.

```
public class Person
{
  private string name;
  private int age;
  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```
