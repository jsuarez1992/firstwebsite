## Exercise 2

#### SVG
**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an _XML-based markup language_ for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics.  
It's main use is to open Web standard for describing images that can be **neatly rendered at any size**. It works in compliance to other web standards like CSS, DOM, JavaScript and SMIL.   
As a former graphic designer, it is _useful to print larger files_ because the file **keeps the quality regarding of the file size**.  
Hence, this is vector format file is chosen over JPEG or PNG when it comes to advertise printing.  

#### MathMl
**Mathematical Markup Language (MML)** is an _XML-based markup language_ for describing mathematical notations and capture both its structure and content.
While LaTeX can also describe mathematics, MathMl **makes the user aware* of the mathematical concepts behind the notation.
As a former economy student, I used softwares which requires these features, such as __SPSS, Stata and Minitab__. These softwares use a language that can store several formulas / variables for further appliances.

#### X3D
**X3D** is an _XML-based markup language_ for representing 3D computer graphics. Its used to render projects in _architecture_, but can also be used for _product design_ as it allows you to render your product, _animation_ -like motion design_ and so on.
There are several applications, most of which are **open-source software**, which natively parse and interpret X3D files, including the 3D graphics and animation editor **Blender** and the Sun Microsystems virtual world client _Project Wonderland_.
